# Achieve
<b>Scheduling Web app</b><br/>
This was my final project for the Harcard's CS50 online course, it was also my first "large" programming project.
I am currently working on a complete rewrite of this project: https://github.com/djjohnsongeek/achieve2

You can check the original web app out at https://djjohnsongeek.pythonanywhere.com<br/>

This is a web app that is meant to generate a schedule for an ABA clinic. For those unfamiliar with ABA it stands for Applied Behavioral Analysis. ABA therapy is used to teach children on the Autism Spectrum. Mostly this means 1:1 sessions where a client is paired with a teacher. Scheduling can be complicated when multiple clients who have multiple teachers on their teams require different hours each day.<br/>
<br/>
Achieve allows users to add, edit and remove staff, classroom and client information to and from database. From there it can generate a daily schedule and save it as an csv file which can be downloaded.<br/>
To see additional planned features checkout the TODO.txt file.
