<b>Scheduling Web app</b>

I am building a web app that is meant to generate a schedule for an ABA clinic. For those unfamiliar with ABA it stands for Applied Behavioral Analysis. ABA therapy is used to teach children on the Autism Spectrum. Mostly this means 1:1 sessions where a client is paired with a teacher. Scheduling can be complicated when multiple clients who have multiple teachers on their teams require different hours each day.

This is my first major product. Any advice or thoughts from more experienced developers is welcome! For now contributions are not going to be accepted as I want this project to be my own. For those who are willing to sift through my code and want to send me advice, THANK YOU!
Please note, much of the design/functionality of the website is still in developement and unfinished. :)
