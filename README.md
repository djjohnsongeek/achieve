<b>Scheduling Web app</b>

This is a web app that is meant to generate a schedule for an ABA clinic. For those unfamiliar with ABA it stands for Applied Behavioral Analysis. ABA therapy is used to teach children on the Autism Spectrum. Mostly this means 1:1 sessions where a client is paired with a teacher. Scheduling can be complicated when multiple clients who have multiple teachers on their teams require different hours each day.<br/>
<br/>
Achieve allows users to add, edit and remove staff, classroom and client information to and from database. From there it can generate a daily schedule and save it as an csv file which can be downloaded.<br/>
To see additional planned features checkout the TODO.txt file.

This is my first project of this scope. Any advice or thoughts from more experienced developers are welcome! For now contributions are not going to be accepted as I want this project to be my own. For those who are willing to sift through my code and want to send me advice, THANK YOU!
